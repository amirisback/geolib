This is collection libraries of utility Google Maps SDK for Android. Build for modern architecture with Kotlin and Coroutine.

Layer customization on Google Maps SDK is not easy. I've done a lot of code work with it. I try to summarize my research in a library which contains several artifacts. The artifacts become a standalone library.

## Artifact and feature
- Location (`com.github.utsmannn.geolib:location`)
- Routes (`com.github.utsmannn.geolib:routes`)
- Polyline Helper (`com.github.utsmannn.geolib:polyline`)
- Marker View (`com.github.utsmannn.geolib:marker`)

### [Location](/docs/artifacts/location-lib)
With location library you can access current location, observer current location and get place or address of current and specified location (search).

### [Routes](/docs/artifacts/routes-lib)
You able to search route between two location.

### [Polyline Helper](/docs/artifacts/polyline-help)
You can animating the polyline with easier code. There is a feature to determine the draw of the animation.

### [Marker View](/docs/artifacts/marker-lib)
Parse layout to original marker or you can create any view as marker. I added the layer for create any view as marker instead original marker.
